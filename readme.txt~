This is a program to interpret the content of MBR,VBR and root directory,
(only support DOS partition(MBR), and FAT file system now)

There are two versions of implementation, 
one is to use "xxd" command then read ascii, which was what I originally did; 
and the other is to read binary files directorly using file access function(fread,fseek...) in C.
The two versions share the same "type_judge.h" file, which are put outside folders.


Compile "mvd.c"(or parse.c) in linux, then run ./mvd(or./parse) <disk or image name>
Then you will see what this program can do...
