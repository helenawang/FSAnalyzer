  "body": "### Welcome to FSAnalyzer\r\nThis is a simple tool I write to list all the files existed in a specific file system in order to get to know about more information in a disk and track the timeline of some files we may concern. Notice that **This is a project for learning.** The implementation refers to that wonderful tool [TSK(The Sleuth Kit)](www.sleuthkit.org) and the book [FSFA(File System Forensic Analysis)](http://www.digital-evidence.org/fsfa/index.html) written by Brain Carrier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### History\r\nIt was in the summer of 2015 that I take a lesson called [Introduction to Digital Forensics](...) and I tried to write my own analyze tool and here it is. During the following months, I tried to add more functions and expand my program to support more file systems. Now it supports FAT(FAT16 and FAT32).\r\n\r\n \r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n2015-2016, Helena Wang(@helenawang)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou may refer to the documentation or wiki for more information. If you are interested in my program or have any problems, feel free to contact @helenawang in github.",
